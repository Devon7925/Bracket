# Bracket
Bracket coding language is based off the idea to use very simple structures to allow full customization and high level use

It is bracket based(obviously) and the java portion should be as lightweight as possible

The only primative is a bit and all other structures are to be built from there

Methods are string arrays of the commands that make them up

see docs for syntax refrence
