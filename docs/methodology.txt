Loops are achieved through recursion

To achieve sub sub elements you can do ('a`.'b`).'c`
This is necessary because it evaluates right to left

"local" variables are local within their operation execution so non operation method
execution does not override them.
Calling another operation will override them until that operation finishes.

in test.bcrt there are two versions of many functions, an operation version and a non-operation 
version. This is necessary so that recursion will work but operation versions are prefered
