Loops are achieved through recursion

To achieve sub sub elements you can do ('a'.'b').'c'
This is necessary because sub element syntax evaluates right to left

"local" variables are local within their operation execution so non operation method
execution does not override them.
Calling another operation will override them until that operation finishes.

Global variables are often necessary but should be avoided
one way to do this is to use :/this to create variables specific to a given function

Most comments can just be added but reserved characters do need to use slashes

in the tests folder there are two versions of many functions, an operation version and a non-operation 
version. This is necessary so that recursion will work, but operation versions are prefered
